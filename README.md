= Elo Rating Tracking for Foosball

After getting a Foosball Table for the Gaslight Software office, it didn't take long for talk of who was the better player and thoughts of a tournament to begin. Getting everyone to agree on the format of a tournament is quite another thing.

However, a bit of research turned up the [Elo Rating system][elo] as modified by [Bonzini USA][bonzini]. This little Rails application implements this scoring system for anyone in the office who plays. It's working so far and the app is becoming a place where we at Gaslight are able to explore some newer gems and techniques.
